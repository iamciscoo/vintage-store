# Cursor Rules

## Instructions

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Always prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
- You are careful to only make changes that requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested.
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation.
- Keep the codebase clean and easy to understand.
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[X]` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never for the dev or production environment.
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or production environment.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming with me.

## Lessons
- Always set runtime to "nodejs" when using bcryptjs in Next.js to avoid Edge Runtime issues
- Add postinstall and vercel-build scripts for proper Prisma setup on Vercel deployment
